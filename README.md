# FishNet
FishNet: One Stage to Detect, Segmentation and Pose Estimation
## Introduction
In this project, we combine target detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection into the same network structure and use a YOLO-like model to give predicted values using one phase. We use the idea of multi-task network to merge the three tasks, and use the labeled fish images as the experimental objects, and finally achieve good results.
## Method
Update Later...
## Result
We have now succeeded in converging the network and obtained good results, more optimized hyperparameters are being debugged, the specific results will be released after the paper is accepted
